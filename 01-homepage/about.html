About Sarah
</h1>

<p class="para-text">

Sarah was born in December 1986. At the age of 20, she became an au pair to help out the parents of two young boys (age 2 and 4) in Munich. She then returned to Luxembourg to become a flight attendant.

​

In January 2015 her son Lionel was born with Milan following in June 2017. Sarah was a devoted and caring mother to her children and was relentless in trying to find new activities for her two boys, in buying new and interesting toys, in feeding them a natural and balanced diet. She spent most of the 4 years at home with them, only having started to go back to work in December 2018.

​

Sarah was loved by many and nobody could ever say a bad word about her. She was caring and understanding, had a heart of gold and would be listening to other people’s grief for hours. She loved children more than anything in the world – not only her own – and had plans to have more children in the future.

​

In February 2019, Sarah fell sick of the Influenza virus and, within just 4 days, passed away at the young age of 32, leaving behind her partner and the two boys.

<h1 class="heading-2">Our Mission
</h1>
<p class="Mission-text">
The Fondation Sarah Grond’s mission is to financially help and provide advice to families in need, either directly or indirectly in Luxembourg, the UK or abroad. The main purpose is to help children that have lost one or both parents.
​The foundation is here to support children and families directly by helping them buy material, clothes, equipment ,finance activities and/or food or indirectly by giving money to foster homes, orphanages, support groups and children in underprivileged homes
​We understand the mental and emotional support in case of a loss of a loved one just as the importance of physical and financial help. The foundation wants to help organizations that provide these services or to pay for sessions with professionals.
To finance these activities, the Fondation Sarah Grond relies on donations from individuals, but is also organizing fund-raising events a number of times a year which will create awareness and increase the number of donations.
