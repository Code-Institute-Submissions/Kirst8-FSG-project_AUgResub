# Fondation Sarah Grond

The Fondation Sarah Grond’s mission is to financially help and provide advice to families in need, either directly or indirectly in Luxembourg, the UK or abroad. The main purpose is to help children that have lost one or both parents.

​The foundation is here to support children and families directly by helping them buy material, clothes, equipment ,finance activities and/or food or indirectly by giving money to foster homes, orphanages, support groups and children in underprivileged homes 

​We understand the mental and emotional support in case of a loss of a loved one just as the importance of physical and financial help. The foundation wants to help organizations that  provide these services or to pay for sessions with professionals.


To finance these activities, the Fondation Sarah Grond relies on donations from individuals, but is also organizing fund-raising events a number of times a year which will create awareness and increase the number of donations.



## UX
### Main objective 

- To make financial help more accessible and provide information and step by step process on what to when losing a loved one. 

- Make it easy for users to navigate their way to the 'Contact Us' page and download links provided for essential information such as paperwork.

- Desgin has to be fully responsive all devices

### User Experience 
1.Administration in the event of death in order to get financial help or other support wasn't very clear and the process did take a long time.
This is not easy to do in general but when grieving it becomes twice as hard.

2.I want easy navigation, a clear step by step process on what to do and how to do it.

3.I want all information provided on any device and easy responsive design especially on a mobile 

4.I want a website that will provide information and services to those in need or looking for assistance

### Design process
1.Intuitive and simple navigation includes 'Home', 'About Us', 'Services and information' and 'Contact Us'.
 
2.The colours and the logo have already been thought of , I wanted to bring out the colours more 

3.I used visual-paradigm(link) for wireframe and explored the colours and fonts and which would work well together .

4.Always keeping the main aim of the website in mind

2.From there, I scrolled to the 'GitHub Pages' section.
3.Here I selected 'master branch' as my Source.
